                                    <p>Her prolific career is a reflection of her values of growth; respect; remaining humble; inclusivity and professionalism. While Madhu began her dancing career as a self-taught dancer from watching movies and dance videos, it was seeking learning anywhere and everywhere that made her a professional.

               <h3 class="a b c s w bc"> Our History</h3>
               <div class="contentblock contentformat contentlinks s w bc">
                  <p>Our dance studio began in 2009 in our home on Sunflower Lane in Plano.  Madhu started teaching a few family friends dance to participate in India Day events.   She soon realized that she could combine her passion for dance with her love for teaching and provide the opportunities our community needed to dance.</p>
                  <p>While continuing to teach at Plano Isd, Haun Elementary, she was able to by 2012 bring staff on board and move into a studio at Hathaway Academy of Ballet. That wasn’t the end of growth for our dance studio!  We are now a team of 12 instructors and an amazing administrative staff.  </p>
                  <p>As we continue to dance our way into our next season, we love to reflect upon the experiences and accomplishments that have defined us for more than 12 years and welcome the excitement of many more seasons to come!</p>
                  <p>As Sasha, Masti’s co-founder and Madhu’s daughter continues to fulfil her dreams as a professional actor in the Telugu Film Industry, Madhu continues to nourish and balance her life with taking care of Masti with utmost care and love. </p>
                  <p>To nurture as well as teach, and encourage children of all levels To encourage by giving children feedback to assess what needs work while also acknowledging their positive progress. To create classroom leaders and role models, so that children have a framework of peer support To motivate our students in class with excellent teaching, and support them (while out of the studio) with online practice and technique videos

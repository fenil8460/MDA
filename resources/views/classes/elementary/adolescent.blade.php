						<p>Teens classes are perfect for you to fall in love with the beautiful art of Bollywood dance or to further your experimentation in different dance styles. This is a dance class with a difference! We are interested in honing in on your natural potential, and want you to enhance our choreography with your personal style. Bollywood is all about expression, and we want you to express exactly who you are, or who you want to be. Come for fitness, to meet new people, to try something new, or because you just love performing. Our teens class consistently wow audiences throughout the year with their complex and energetic showcases.</p>
